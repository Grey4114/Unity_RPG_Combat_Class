The NewSaving folder and all of its scripts were created to follow along with the 
lessons in the Saving System section of the course.  During this section these
scripts will be attached to assets/objects for training purposes and then removed 
after this section has been completed.  Each script will contain infor as to which 
object it is attached to.

All of these scripts were previously downloads in the Saving Asset Pack section 
of the course and are stored in the Saving folder.
